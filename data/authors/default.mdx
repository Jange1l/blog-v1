Welcome to my personal website. My name is Juan Angel Suarez and I am a software engineer. Currently, I am the co-founder of [Equiply](https://www.equiply.io/), where we help hospitals spend smarter on medical equipment.

Prior to starting Equiply, I worked at JP Morgan's Highbridge Capital, where I worked on trading systems.

Equiply is backed by [Antler](https://www.antler.co/), a global early-stage investor that supports exceptional founders from day zero.

I will be using this website to write about my entrepreneurial journey, discoveries and opinions on various technologies, as well as helpful how-to guides.

Let's build together!
