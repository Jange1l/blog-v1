Welcome to my personal website. My name is Juan Angel Suarez and I am a full stack software engineer with experience in mobile and web development. Currently I am applying my problem solving skills at Highbridge Capital.

I will be using this website to write about my discoveries and opinions on various technologies, as well as helpful how-to guides, as I progress through my journey of software engineering.

Lets build together!
