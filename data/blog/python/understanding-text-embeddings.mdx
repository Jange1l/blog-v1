Have you ever wondered how your smartphone understands your questions or how search engines seem to read your mind? The answer lies within text embeddings.

Whether you're a budding data scientist, a seasoned software engineer, or somewhere in between, understanding text embeddings can fundamentally level up your approach to text data. As a software engineer who loves to explore, I find text embeddings particularly cool and immensely powerful. Today, I’m going to break down what text embeddings are, how they work, and show you some real-world applications where they shine. Ready? Let's dive in!

### What Are Text Embeddings?

At its core, a text embedding is a technique for representing text in a form that computers can understand (think numbers, not letters) and process efficiently. Why is this needed, you ask? Well, while humans excel at understanding written content, computers do not—they need numbers. Embeddings convert text into a dense vector of floating-point values where similar text results in similar numerical values. This magic lets us perform all sorts of machine learning wizardry on natural language.

### How Do Text Embeddings Work?

Imagine trying to understand the relationship between words without reading them but by looking at numbers instead. Text embeddings allow exactly that by capturing semantic meaning and relationships in a dense vector space. 

### Real-World Applications of Text Embeddings:

1. **Search Engines**: Improve the relevance of search results by understanding the query and content in the same vector space.
2. **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest relevant articles or products by finding similarity between the users' text inputs and available options.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment expressed in texts by training classifiers using vectorized forms of text.

### Challenges in Using Text Embeddings

While text embeddings have revolutionized how machines understand human language, their use is not without challenges. These challenges not only affect the performance of machine learning models but also raise important ethical considerations. Here, we will explore three main challenges: dimensionality, contextuality, and bias.

#### [Dimensionality](https://www.juansuarez.me/blog/python/understanding-dimensionality)

One of the inherent challenges in using text embeddings is dealing with high-dimensional data. Text data is naturally sparse and typically requires a large dimension space to be represented effectively as embeddings. High dimensionality can lead to several problems:

- **Computational Complexity**: The more dimensions an embedding has, the more computational resources are required to process data. This can make training models slower and more expensive.
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: In high-dimensional spaces, the volume of the space increases so much that the available data become sparse.
 This sparsity is problematic for methods requiring statistical significance, as the data needed often grows exponentially with dimensionality.
- **Overfitting**: With too many dimensions, models can become overly complex. This complexity can lead to overfitting, where a model learns details and noise in the training data to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data.

Techniques such as dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) or using more sophisticated embedding methods (like those generated by deep learning models that inherently manage dimensionality) are commonly employed to mitigate these issues.

#### Contextuality

The meaning of words can change based on the context in which they are used, a property known as polysemy. Traditional embedding techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe assign a single vector to each word, ignoring the different meanings that word can have in different contexts. For instance, the word "bank" can refer to the edge of a river or a financial institution depending on the sentence in which it is used.

This limitation can be addressed by context-aware embeddings like BERT or ELMo, which generate embeddings for words based on the other words in the sentence. Thus, the word "bank" would have different embeddings in "He sat on the bank of the river" versus "He deposited money in the bank," allowing models to better capture and utilize the nuances of language.

#### Bias

Text embeddings can inadvertently encode and perpetuate biases present in the training data. Since embeddings learn from existing text data, any biases — gender, race, age, etc. — in that data can be reflected in the model's behavior. For example, embeddings might associate certain professions more closely with one gender than another.

The ethical implications are significant, as biased models can lead to unfair or prejudiced outcomes when used in applications like hiring tools, search engines, or recommendation systems. Addressing this issue involves techniques such as bias identification and mitigation in embedding models, or using more balanced and representative training data.

# Embedding Models In Action
### Word2Vec: Mastering Word-Level Semantics

Introduced by Google in 2013, Word2Vec is an effective model that focuses on individual words, creating dense vector representations. It excels at capturing semantic and syntactic relationships between words, which is ideal for:

- Finding similar words and word associations.
- Solving analogies.
- Boosting algorithms that rely on local context understanding.

#### In the following examples I will show you how you can leverage text embeddings to do the following:
1. Initialize and train a Word2Vec model
2. View embeddings per word 
3. Find semantically related words
4. Compute the similarity (distance) between two words

Here’s how you can implement Word2Vec with Python:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

# Example sentences
sentences = [
    ["data", "science", "is", "fun"],
    ["machine", "learning", "is", "awesome"],
    ["machine", "learning", "is", "fun"],
    ["deep", "learning", "is", "a", "subfield", "of", "machine", "learning"],
    ["nlp", "is", "a", "subfield", "of", "artificial", "intelligence"],
    ["the", "king", "rules", "his", "kingdom"],
    ["the", "queen", "rules", "her", "kingdom"],
    ["a", "prince", "is", "a", "young", "king"],
    ["a", "princess", "is", "a", "young", "queen"],
    ["man", "works", "woman", "works"],
    ["he", "is", "strong", "she", "is", "strong"],
    ["his", "robe", "her", "robe"]
]

# Initialize and train a Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

print('Keys in the model: ', list(model.wv.key_to_index))
```
**Output**: Keys in the model:  ['is', 'a', 'learning', 'machine', 'robe', 'kingdom', 'fun', 'subfield', 'of', 'the', 'rules', 'his', 'king', 'queen', 'strong', 'works', 'young', 'her', 'deep', 'science', 'he', 'woman', 'awesome', 'man', 'princess', 'nlp', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'prince', 'she', 'data']

```python
# View embeddings per word 
vector = model.wv['data']
print("Vector for 'data':", vector)
```
**Output**: Vector for 'data': [ 1.9567307e-04  2.1450371e-03  1.0661827e-03  7.5868950e-03

### OpenAI's Ada: Unleashing Document-Level Insights

On the flip side, OpenAI’s Ada model text-embedding-ada-002 provides embeddings that encapsulate the semantic meaning of entire text sequences or documents. It is more suited for:

- Semantic search across large documents.
- Clustering and similarity measurement at sentence or document levels.
- Integrating contextual nuances over longer stretches of text.

Ada's embeddings are accessible via OpenAI’s API, offering ease of use and integration into larger systems without the need for extensive local setup.


Here's a quick example of using OpenAI's API to generate embeddings with Ada and their different use cases:

```bash
pip install openai
```
```python
import openai
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

# Text for which you want to generate embeddings
text = "Machine learning is fascinating."

# Generate embeddings
response = openAiClient.embeddings.create(
  model="text-embedding-ada-002",
  input=text
).data[0].embedding

# Print the embedding vector
embedding_vector = response
print("Embedding vector:", embedding_vector)
```

**Output:** Embedding vector:

EXPLANATION

1. Highly Related Texts Expected Outcome: These two texts are very closely related as 
both discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on a broad scale. 
Therefore, the cosine similarity should be high, indicating a strong similarity.

2. Moderately Related Texts Expected Outcome: These texts are related through the theme
of future technologies affecting the world, but they focus on different technologies 
(quantum computing vs. AI). The cosine similarity should be moderate, reflecting the 
thematic but distinct technological focus.

3. Unrelated Texts Expected Outcome: These texts discuss completely different subjects—one
is about technology and the other about health. The cosine similarity should be low,
showing little to no relation between the content of the texts. 

4. Identical Text Expected Outcome: Since the texts are identical, the cosine similarity 
should be 1, indicating that the texts are exactly the same.

5. Text With Opposing Ideas Expected Outcome: These texts present opposing ideas regarding 
energy sources and policy. The cosine similarity could still be moderate if the embeddings 
capture the context of energy and policy discussions, but it should reflect the ideological differences.
